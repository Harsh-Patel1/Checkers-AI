# Checkers-AI
Using Deep Q Learning, which combines Deep learning and Reinforcement learning, I created a checkers AI that can play checkers at a moderate level. 

# Usage
To try this AI, copy and paste the code into an IDE (such as VScode) train a model with an x number of episodes (or use an already trained model), and change the path of the file to that model. After you load the trained model, run the program and choose mode 2. 

# Note
You must download all the required installations mentioned in the notebook.
